# This makefile runs some tests.  The focus this week
# are the data structure tests

# This is an optional feature to the student's repository for
# Assignment #2.  If a student decides to include a Makefile here, 
# they need to make sure to add their own make targets. On the other
# hand, if a student decides not to include a Makefile here, they need
# to make sure to reflect that in their last update of this repository
# (i.e., by checking whether omitting this Makefile would impact other
# makefiles. If if does, make sure to fix the conflicts.)
