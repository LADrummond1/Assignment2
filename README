This is the main directory which contains a series of utilities, 
data structures functions, a scheduler application and functionality
tests for Assignment #2

LIST OF SUBDIRECTORIES IN THIS DIRECTORY:
- Bin/ : This subdirectory contains all the executable program
	
- Lib/ : This subdirectory contains all data structure libraries (.a)
		
- Include/: This subdirectory contains all the function prototypes 
		and global symbold definitions (.h include files)
		
- Source/ : This directory contains all the source code with the
		core data structures functionality implemented in C++ for 
		Assignment #2.  
		
- Tests: Test programs used to verify and validate the functionality 
		of the software developed for Assignment 2. Some of these 
		tests are performance verification tests for performance 
		analysis

- Utils: Contains all the source files that implement utilities
		like timing, plotting, and random number generation functions, 
        hash functions. For Assignment #2.

- Applications:  For assignment #2, we are building a single processor
		scheduler for processes. The scheduler is built inside 
		Applications/Scheduler

LIST OF FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY:
- README (this file - make sure you add your own comments here)

- Makefile: Global automation commands. 
 
- scheduler_test1.txt: 	Test data for the runtime scheduler 
		(experiment #1)

- scheduler_test2.txt:	Additional test data for the runtime 
		scheduler (experiment 2)

- appendixA.cpp: code snippets included in the Appendix A from 
		Assignment 2's instructions
